##  Overview

A scalable, layered architecture that transforms raw source data (CRM & ERP) into clean, business-ready analytics using SQL Server and the Medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold).

**Key Features:**
- Complete ETL process with raw-to-report lineage
- Star schema data model optimized for reporting
- Automated stored procedures with logging
- Data quality checks and business rule enforcement
- Fully documented diagrams, data catalog, and project plan

##  Architecture

![Data Architecture](assets/data_architecture.png)

- **Bronze Layer:** Raw data ingestion (CSV â†’ SQL)
- **Silver Layer:** Cleansed and enriched data
- **Gold Layer:** Star schema model (fact & dimensions)

---

##  Tech Stack

- SQL Server Express + SQL Server Management Studio
- Git for version control
- [Draw.io](http://draw.io/) for diagramming
- Notion for project planning

---

##  ETL Workflows

### Bronze

- Schema mirrors source structure
- Full reload using `BULK INSERT`
- Basic validation (row count, schema match)

### Silver

- Cleansing: deduplication, normalization, null handling
- Standardized with metadata (`dw_create_date`)
- Full load with `load_silver` stored procedure

### Gold

- Fact + dimension views with surrogate keys
- Business rules enforced
- Optimized for reporting tools
